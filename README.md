# Space Invaders
A recreation of the space invaders arcade game made with Python.

Move left with the left arrow key, move right with the right arrow key, and use space to shoot!

This was a fun project, where I used the Turtle library to re-imagine Space Invaders.
I created all enemy and player sprites, and added some new fun features to make the game more interesting and challenging.  
The aliens will move faster as you take them out, and shoot several different kinds of bullets.  
Dont let the aliens breach your defenses, and watch out for the super alien ship!
